		Treat modelling security as a quality apptribute
		
		What does secure mean to u

Container - Your software wrapped in a complete filesystem containing everything it needs to run
Image - We are talking about docker images; read-only and used to create containers
Pod - One or more docker containers that run together
Service - Provides a common DNS name to access a pod (or replicated set of pods)
Project - A project is a group of services that are related logically
Deployment - an update to your application triggered by a image change or config change
Build - The process of turning your source code into a runnable image
BuildConfig - configuration data that determines how to manage your build
Route - a labeled and DNS mapped network path to a service from outside OpenShift
Master - The foreman of the OpenShift architecture; the master schedules operations, watches for problems, and orchestrates everything
Node - Where the compute happens; your software is run on nodes
Pipeline - Automates the control, building, deploying, and promoting your applications on OpenShift
